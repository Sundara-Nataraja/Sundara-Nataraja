"The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris." - Larry Wall

Laziness: I'm too lazy to do the same task repeatedly so write scripts to do that task for me. This makes people think I am intelligent.

Impatience: I'm too impatient to wait for my code to run so rewrite the code to improve performance. This makes people think I am a good programmer.

Hubris: When someone asks if I can do something I just say Yes, then go find out how to do it (Google!). This makes people think I can do anythin
